	* ChangeLog:
	  Recent changes.
	* configure, configure.in, mpiPconfig.h.in, mpiPi.c, mpiPi.h.in,
	  report.c:
	  This commit adds substantial reporting changes to address memory
	  use for
	  platforms such as Blue Gene.
	  
	  The previous reporting mechanism is the default configuration,
	  but the new low-memory-use approach can be configured with the
	  --enable-low-mem-report configure flag, which defines
	  LOW_MEM_REPORT in
	  mpiPconfig.h.
	  
	  Instead of aggregating all process information at a single
	  process,
	  process-specific information is printed by allocating
	  sizeof(callsite_stats_t)*process_count and iterating through
	  callsites
	  using PMPI_Gather to collect and then print process-specific
	  callsite information.
	  
	  This results in a fixed amount of memory use which is independent
	  of the number of
	  MPI callsites in the application.
	* glob.c:
	  Patch version update to reflect changes.
	* diag_msgs.c:
	  Make debug messages have consistent debug label DBG.
	* Makefile.in:
	  Specify '-gnu' option for indent to override any local
	  .indent.pro settings.

	  o Added DISABLE_BFD macro to avoid recompiling pc_lookup.c when
	  BFD is
	  not used on systems that build a separate demangling library.
	  o Set API_TARGET once an refer to macro in other cases that
	  reference the API lib.
	  o Install taget copies timer include file directory structure.
	  o Added Cray F77_VENDOR test for X1E support.
	  o mpiP_find_src_loc returns failure and optionally prints a
	  debugging message
	  if the input pc value is NULL, rather than failing an assert.

	  Redundant MPI declarations seemed unnecessary and prone to
	  distracting
	  warning messages.
	* Makefile.in:
	  Added additional header file dependencies for thoroughness.
	* make-wrappers.py:
	  An extra malloc was messing up fortran opaque object conversion.

	  Added configure test to address MPIR_ToPointer problem with
	  Quadrics MPI.
	  Also fixed compile warning if no stack trace parameters have been

	  for the current architechture and libunwind is not being used.

2005-04-01  chcham

	* configure:
	  Attempt to figure out different function calls between binutils
	  2.15 and 2.15.96
	* testing/4-demangle.src:

2005-03-31  chcham

	* Makefile.in, diag_msgs_api.c:
	  Added diag_msgs_api.c and Makefile.in target libmpiP-API.a

	* mpiPi_proto.h:
	  Removed __STDC__ conditional that wreaked havoc on IBM default
	  MPI compile scripts.
	* make-wrappers.py:
	  Second pass at Fortran/C conversion in the make-wrappers script

2005-03-30  chcham

	* pcontrol.c:
	  Somehow long ago the line that disables profiling with

	  an
	  test...
	* Defs.mak.in, Makefile.in, make-wrappers.py, mpi.protos.txt.in:
	  Modifications to handle 64-bit plaforms where MPI_Fint is not
	  the same size as MPI_Request and other opaque objects.
	  
	  This currently appears to be an issue on ia64 and x86_64. An
	  --xlate
	  argument is passed to the python wrapper script to add code for
	  translation
	  between Fortran and C objects in the wrappers.c file.
