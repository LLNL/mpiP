		    Porting Instructions for MPIP

Most of MPIP is C code, so it ports relatively easy to new
platforms. It does however require access to certain libraries and
header files during compilation. Also, there are a few architecture
specific modules, but they are localized.


Libraries:

- MPI
- GNU BFD (part of binutils)

Executables:

- GNU make
- Python - any recent version (>1.5) of Python should work

MPIP uses the MPI_Wtime timer to gather timing information, so timer
access is portable.

MPIP walks the stack to gather the stack frames for MPI calls. THIS IS
ARCHITECTURE DEPENDENT. This portion of the port takes investgative
work. The macros (in file mpiPi.h)

      ParentFP
      FramePC
      NextFP

must be completed for your architecture. The easiest way to do this is
to use a debugger to interrogate the stack of a simple application and
calculate the offsets for the PC and stack frame pointer.
