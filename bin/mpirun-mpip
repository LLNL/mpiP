#  If the application has been linked against an SO MPI library and 
#  SO versions of libmpiP, libbfd, and libiberty are available, this
#  script should preload libmpiP such that MPI routines are profiled
#  and an mpiP report is generated.
#
#  This script is a wrapper for mpirun.  The use of "mpirun" to run a
#  parallel job can be replaced with "mpirun-mpip".  
#
#  You may need to preload other objects based on your MPI implementation
#  and compiler.
